##Introduction to Geographic Information Systems
<br>
The goal of this course is to introduce the students to the basics of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cartography and spatial analysis through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises. The course is given through a set of modules that include:

<ul style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>1. Basic concepts: </strong>Definitions and applications of GIS | Vector and raster data structures | Coordinate systems | Geographical data bases</li>
  <li><strong>2. Intro to GIS software: </strong>Software installation | Introduction to the GIS graphical user interface | Creation and edition of geographic data | Management of attribute data | Cartographic principles | Map design</li>
  <li><strong>3. Spatial analysis: </strong>Attribute-based operations | Distance-based operations | Overlay operations | Surfaces and neighborhood operations | Map algebra | Statistical analyses | Network analysis</li>
  <li><strong>4. Advanced applications: </strong>Intro to web mapping | Spatial data analysis with the R language | Intro to programming for GIS
</ul>

I have taught this course several times for different departments at the [National University of Colombia] using free and open source software, including [QGIS] and [GRASS GIS], as well as commercial packages such as [ArcGIS]. I also worked as teaching assistant for the Intro to GIS class at [Clark University] during the Fall semester in 2012. The lab exercises were conducted using ArcGIS and [IDRISI].

##Digital Image Processing
<br>
The goal of this course is to introduce the students to the basics of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cartography and spatial analysis through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises. The course is given through a set of modules that include:

<ul style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>1. Basic concepts: </strong>Definitions and applications of GIS | Vector and raster data structures | Coordinate systems | Geographical data bases</li>
  <li><strong>2. Intro to GIS software: </strong>Installation | Introduction to the graphical user interface | Creation of geographic data | Management of attribute data | Cartographic principles | Map design</li>
  <li><strong>3. Spatial analysis: </strong>Definitions and applications of GIS | Vector and raster data structures | Coordinate systems | Geographical data bases</li>
  <li><strong>4. Advanced applications: </strong>Intro to web mapping | Spatial data analysis with the R language
</ul>

I taught this course to students in the M.Sc. program in Geomatics at the National University of Colombia during the Spring semester in 2012. The labs were conducted using [ENVI] and the [R language]. I also taught some of these modules to students at the GIS and Geomatics graduate programs (2008-2010) at the [Agustin Codazzi Geographic Institute].

##Intro to Geostatistics
<br>
The goal of this course is to introduce the students to the basics of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cartography and spatial analysis through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises. The course is given through a set of modules that include:

<ul style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>1. Review of basic statistical concepts: </strong>Central tendency and spread measures | Probability distributions | Correlation and linear regression | Random variables</li>
  <li><strong>2. Statistical analysis of spatial data: </strong>Intro to spatial statistics science | Exploratory spatial data analysis | Spatial autocorrelation</li>
  <li><strong>3. Basic geostatistical concepts: </strong>Intro to geostatistics and its applications | Regionalized variable theory | Stationarity | Anisotropy | Theoretical semivariogram models</li>
  <li><strong>4. Spatial prediction through geostatistical methods: </strong>Kriging definition and applications | Linear kriging methods | Non-linear kriging methods | Block kriging | Co-kriging | Cross-validation
  <li><strong>5. Spatial prediction through deterministic methods: </strong>Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation | Global and local polynomial interpolation | Radial basis function interpolation | Voronoi (Thiessen) polygons tesselation
  <li><strong>6. Spatial sampling networks design: </strong>Sampling networks types | Design by sequential points method | Design by simultaneous points method | Optimization through genetic algorithms 
</ul>

I taught this course at the graduate program in Geographic Information Systems at the [University of Manizales] during the Fall 2008. The labs were conducted using the [ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst] extension and the [R language].

##Data Analysis with the R Language
<br>
I'm currently preparing this new course for introducing people to the analysis of qualitative and quantitative data using the [R language]. Evolutionary optimization of spatial sampling networks. An application of genetic algorithms and geostatistics for the monitoring of soil organic carbon. Editorial Academica Espanola. Saarbrucken, Germany. 183 p. ISBN: 978-3-8454-9815-7. (In Spanish) Available at [amazon.com][Santacruz_2011b_1] and
