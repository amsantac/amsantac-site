## Introduction to Geographic Information Systems

<br>

The goal of this course is to introduce students with the basics of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), cartography and spatial analysis through a series of lectures and hands-on exercises. The course is given through a set of modules that includes:

<ul style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>1. Basic concepts: </strong>Definitions and applications of GIS | Vector and raster data structures | Coordinate systems | Geographical data bases</li>
  <li><strong>2. Intro to GIS software: </strong>Software installation | Introduction to the GIS graphical user interface | Creation and edition of geographic data | Management of attribute data | Cartographic principles | Map design</li>
  <li><strong>3. Spatial analysis: </strong>Attribute-based operations | Distance-based operations | Overlay operations | Surfaces and neighborhood operations | Map algebra | Statistical analyses | Network analysis</li>
  <li><strong>4. Advanced applications: </strong>Intro to web mapping | Spatial data analysis with the R language | Intro to programming for GIS</li>
</ul>

I have taught this course several times for different departments at the [National University of Colombia] using free and open source software, including [QGIS] and [GRASS GIS], as well as commercial packages such as [ArcGIS]. I also worked as teaching assistant for the Intro to GIS class at [Clark University] during the Fall semester in 2012. The lab exercises were conducted using ArcGIS and [IDRISI].

## Intro to Remote Sensing and Digital Image Processing

<br>

This course seeks students develop a good understanding and basic skills of remote sensing. The main techniques and tools used to visualize, process, and analyze remotely sensed data are introduced to students through oral presentations and lab exercises. The course is taught with an emphasis on the environmental applications of remote sensing. The following topics are presented during this course:

<ul style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>1. Remote sensing fundamentals: </strong>Definition of RS | History and applications of RS  | Physical principles of RS</li>
  <li><strong>2. Sensors and platforms: </strong>Satellite, airplane and drone RS platforms | Passive RS sensors (multispectral scanners) | Active RS sensors (radar, lidar) | Spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolution of a sensor system</li>
  <li><strong>3. Image interpretation and exploration: </strong>Criteria for visual interpretation | True and false color composites | Statistical analysis of digital images</li>
  <li><strong>4. Preprocessing of remotely sensed data: </strong>Radiometric calibration | Atmospheric correction | Geometric correction</li>
  <li><strong>5. Image enhancement and transformation: </strong>Contrast adjustment | Intensity-Hue-Saturation Transformation | Image fusion | Low- and high-pass filters | Principal components analysis | Tasseled Cap transformation | Vegetation indices</li>
  <li><strong>6. Image classification and change detection: </strong>Unsupervised classifcation | Supervised classification | Object-oriented classification | Accuracy assessment | Change detection methodologies</li>
  <li><strong>7. Advanced machine learning techniques for supervised classification: </strong>Neural networks | Recursive partitioning | Random Forests | Support vector machines | Model ensemble</li>
</ul>

I taught this course to students in the M.Sc. program in Geomatics at the National University of Colombia during the Spring semester in 2012. The labs were conducted using [ENVI] and the [R language]. I also taught some of these modules to students at the GIS and Geomatics graduate programs (2008-2010) at the [Agustin Codazzi Geographic Institute].

## Intro to Geostatistics

<br>
This course gives the students an insight into geostatistics, both in theory and in practice. The first part introduces the students with the fundamentals and basic techniques of statistical and geostatistical analysis. The second part deals with application of geostatistical principles to spatial prediction and the design of optimal spatial sampling networks. The course is structured as follows:

<ul style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>1. Review of basic statistical concepts: </strong>Central tendency and spread measures | Probability distributions | Correlation and linear regression | Random variables</li>
  <li><strong>2. Statistical analysis of spatial data: </strong>Intro to spatial statistics science | Exploratory spatial data analysis | Spatial autocorrelation</li>
  <li><strong>3. Basic geostatistical concepts: </strong>Intro to geostatistics and its applications | Regionalized variable theory | Stationarity | Anisotropy | Theoretical semivariogram models</li>
  <li><strong>4. Spatial prediction through geostatistical methods: </strong>Kriging definition and applications | Linear kriging methods | Non-linear kriging methods | Block kriging | Co-kriging | Cross-validation</li>
  <li><strong>5. Spatial prediction through deterministic methods: </strong>Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation | Global and local polynomial interpolation | Radial basis function interpolation | Voronoi (Thiessen) polygons tesselation</li>
  <li><strong>6. Spatial sampling networks design: </strong>Sampling networks design steps | Sequential points method for network design | Simultaneous points method for network design | Optimal network search through genetic algorithms</li> 
</ul>

I taught this course at the graduate program in Geographic Information Systems at the [University of Manizales] during the Fall 2008. The labs were conducted using the [ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst] extension and the [R language].

## Data Analysis with the R Language

<br>
I'm currently preparing this new course for introducing students to the analysis of quantitative data using the [R language] and other modern tools. The course covers the essential techniques for collecting, cleaning, visualizing and processing raw data and turn them into actionable knowlegde. The course also provides a practical introduction to techniques widely-used today by data scientists to generate modern data analysis reports in a reproducible manner. The following topics are covered:    

<ul style="margin-left:2em; list-style-type:none">
  <li><strong>1. Introduction to data analysis: </strong>What is data science? | Required skills and tools for data scientists | Structure of a data analysis</li>
  <li><strong>2. Introduction to R: </strong>What is R? | Overview and history of R | R command line and graphical user interface | Integrated development environments (IDEs) for R | R installation | R packages overview and applications | Package installation</li>
