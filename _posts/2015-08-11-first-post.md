Hi there! Welcome to my blog!

I'll be posting about topics related to the application of programming for the processing, visualization and analysis of spatial data, especially using the [R language].

I have been programming for 10+ years for performing different kind of tasks in fields such as geostatistics, optimization of spatial sampling networks and the processing of geographic and remotely-sensed data, among others. The application of scripting languages to automate the execution of otherwise time-consuming tasks has helped me a lot to be more efficient in a number of academic and professional activities. Through this blog I want to share what I have learned so far and what I am learning these days. 

Feel free to comment and give (hopefully constructive!) feedback. Hope you enjoy the reading!
