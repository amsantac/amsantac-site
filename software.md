<h2 style= "color:#1e6bb8">R PACKAGES</h2>
<br>
## The geospt package
<br>
This R package provides a set of techniques for geostatistical analysis and for the design of optimal spatial sampling networks. It includes variogram estimation through the trimmed mean, summary statistics for cross-validation and the design of optimal sampling networks through sequential and simultaneous points methods using genetic algorithms, among other functionalities. The package is available at [CRAN][geospt_CRAN] and [GitHub][geospt_github]. 

<br>
## The diffeR package
<br>
The diffeR package implements a set of metrics of difference for comparing pairs of maps representing real or categorical variables at original and multiple resolutions. The package can be downloaded and installed from [CRAN][differ_CRAN] and [GitHub][differ_github]. 

<br>
## The TOC package
<br>
This R package allows the construction of the Receiver (aka Relative) Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Total Operating Characteristic (TOC) curve for spatial and non-spatial data. The ROC curve is a widely-popular statistical technique used for evaluating the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The TOC method is a novel modification of the ROC method that has been introduced recently by [Professor Gil Pontius] from Clark University. The TOC package can be installed from [CRAN][toc_CRAN] and [GitHub][toc_github].

<h2 style= "color:#1e6bb8">WEB APPS</h2>
<br>
## TOC Shiny App
<br>
The TOC R Shiny web application allows the construction of the ROC curve and the TOC curve for spatial and non-spatial data through a graphical user interface. Click <a href="https://amsantac.shinyapps.io/TOCapp" target="_blank">here to launch the app in full screen</a>.

## The Llanos Google Earth Engine App
<br>
The Llanos GEE App displays Landsat imagery (Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI) in false color composite (RGB: near infrared/short wave infrared/red) from 2000 to 2014 for the tropical ecorregion known as the Llanos savannas located in Colombia, South America. Clouds and Landsat 7 SLC-off gaps are masked and filled following a maximum annual NDVI composite approach. This app is powered by [Google Earth Engine]. Click <a href="https://llanos-app-v2.appspot.com/" target="_blank">here to launch this app in full screen</a> (it may take about 20 seconds for the app to load).
