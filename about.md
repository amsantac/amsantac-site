<strong>Hi, I'm Ali!</strong> 

I am a geomatician with a passion for <a href="http://r-project.org">(R!)</a> programming and data mapping. Currently I'm pursuing a PhD degree in Geography at <a href="http://www.clarku.edu">Clark University</a>. My dissertation research focuses on the environmental impacts of land cover and land use change on tropical savannas. My current interests involve remote sensing, environmental modeling, machine learning for image processing, and automation of data processing using high-level programming languages.
</p>


I graduated from the [National University of Colombia] as a Forest Engineer in 2004 and as a Master in Geomatics in 2010. Through the past years I found I'm also passionate about teaching and making my knowledge available to others through the Web. I enjoy helping students and colleagues by sharing my expertise and experience about processing geospatial data and the development of desktop programs and web apps. 

More about me? Well, one of my favorite phrases is: **You can do that with R!** (*You will probably hear that from me more than once!*)
